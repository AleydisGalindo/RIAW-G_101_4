Thus, Precision and Recall vary as the user proceeds with their examination of the set A.\n","\n","\n","If we want to benchmark different systems about how well are they ranking the result documents, we need:\n","\n","- A collection of **documents** that have to be representative of what we expect to find in reality;\n","- A collection of **information needs** that has to be representative of what a user might have in reality;\n","- Human relevance assessment for the (information need, document) pairs.\n","\n","Information retrieval systems (like search engines) can express the relevance for a (information need, document) pair in a **binary** way or through **multiple levels**.\n","\n","Here follow some common metrics used for the evaluation of a retrieval system:\n","\n","### Rank-Based Measures\n","- ##### Binary relevance\n","    - Precision at K (P@K)\n","    - Average Precision at K (P@K)\n","    - Mean Average Precision (MAP)\n","    - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)\n","\n","K is the number of recommendations or ranked documents\n","    \n","- ##### Multiple levels of relevance\n","    - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)\n","\n","Notice that we only mentioned Precision but not Recall.

These two formulations of DCG are the same when the relevance values of documents are binary.\n","\n","**Normalized DCG (NDCG):** If you calculate DCG for different queries you’ll find that some queries are just harder than others and will produce lower DCG scores than easier queries. Normalization solves this problem by scaling the results based off of the best result seen. This is done by sorting all relevant documents in the corpus by their relative relevance, producing the maximum possible DCG through position $n$, also called **Ideal DCG (IDCG)** through that position (*usually it is the ground truth*).\n","\n","$$NDCG_{pos} = \\frac{DCG_{pos}}{iDCG}\\tag{8}$$\n","\n","![Figure 4](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12RqeSAG9lFQ3QvwynxG_FdLEdhltBnow)\n","<caption><center> <u> <font color=''> Figure 4 </u><font color=''> : Computation of NDCG </br>\n","    (Picture taken from https://medium.com/swlh/rank-aware-recsys-evaluation-metrics-5191bba16832)</center></caption>  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lD5hxYgyroGi"},"source":["Implement the functions:\n","- ```dcg_at_k(y_score, doc_score, k)``` based on formula $7$  \n","- ```ndcg_at_k(y_score, doc_score, k)```\n","\n","Compute:\n","- the $NDCG@10$ for query with ```query_id=0```\n","- the average $NDCG@10$ (considering all queries/rankings)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":41,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":375,"status":"ok","timestamp":1697557605334,"user":{"displayName":"MALENA BRONER ÁLVAREZ","userId":"16241084494547220106"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"ZcuzmjN7roGi"},"outputs":[],"source":["def dcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k=10):\n","    order = np.argsort(y_score)[::-1]  # get the list of indexes of the predicted score sorted in descending order.\n","    doc_score = np.take(doc_score, order[:k])  # sort the actual relevance label of the documents based on predicted score(hint: np.take) and take first k.\n","    gain = 2**doc_score - 1   # Compute gain (use formula 7 above)\n","    discounts = np.log2(np.arange(len(doc_score)) + 2)  # Compute denominator\n","    return np.sum(gain / discounts)  #return dcg@k\n","\n","def ndcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k=10):\n","    dcg_max = dcg_at_k(doc_score, doc_score, k) # Ideal dcg\n","    if not dcg_max:\n","        return 0\n","    return np.round(dcg_at_k(doc_score, y_score, k), 4) # return ndcg@k"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8-4-c0wZroGi"},"source":["##### the  𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺@10 for query with query_id=0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":274,"status":"ok","timestamp":1697557607252,"user":{"displayName":"MALENA BRONER ÁLVAREZ","userId":"16241084494547220106"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"_DxJLrcQroGi","outputId":"b05c6cd7-73bc-4d12-9ffa-211622e84d7c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["ndcg@10 for query with query_id=0: 12.9318\n"]}],"source":["query_id = 0\n","k = 10\n","labels = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == query_id][\"doc_score\"])\n","scores = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == query_id][\"predicted_relevance\"])\n","ndcg_k = np.round(ndcg_at_k(labels, scores, k), 4)\n","print(\"ndcg@{} for query with query_id={}: {}\".format(k, query_id, ndcg_k))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ou0rQNsUroGi"},"source":["##### the average  𝑁𝐷𝐶𝐺@10  (considering all queries/rankings)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2884,"status":"ok","timestamp":1697557786119,"user":{"displayName":"MALENA BRONER ÁLVAREZ","userId":"16241084494547220106"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"WSWwZjCFroGi","outputId":"ed700ca9-5f9f-4bc6-d5c9-0db406a7b740"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Average ndcg@10: 10.7285\n"]}],"source":["ndcgs = []\n","k = 10\n","for q in search_results['query_id'].unique(): # loop over all query ids\n","    labels = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == q][\"doc_score\"]) ## get labels for current query\n","    scores = np.array(search_results[search_results['query_id'] == q][\"predicted_relevance\"]) # get predicted score for current query\n","    ndcgs.append(ndcg_at_k(labels, scores, k)) # append NDCG for current query\n","\n","avg_ndcg = np.round(sum(ndcgs) / len(ndcgs), 4) # Compute average NDCG\n","print(\"Average ndcg@{}: {}\".format(k, avg_ndcg))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
